## About me

I'm 22. Few years ago i retired from the career of an ice-hockey player. Now it's time for new challenges. Discipline, communication and team play are familiar to me. My goal now is to learn programming and develop my skills to find a job. Work hard, play hard!

## Skills 

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript (basic)
* Git

## Code Example 

``` javascript
function evenOrOdd(number) {
  if (number % 2 === 0){
    return 'Even';
  } else {
    return 'Odd';
  }
};
```
